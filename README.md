## Features

### 🐦 Free as a Bird — No Copilot Required
Works with **Ollama** (local, totally free), **Anthropic Claude** (pay-as-you-go), or **OpenAI**. Bring your own API key. No GitHub Copilot subscription needed.

### 🧠 Understands Your Whole Codebase (Pro)
Freebird indexes your workspace and reads any file on demand. Ask it to refactor a module, trace a bug across files, or add a feature — it reads the relevant files first, then makes targeted edits with your approval.

### ✏️ Makes Real Code Changes (Pro)
The AI creates and edits files directly in your workspace. Every write, edit, or destructive action shows an **Approve / Reject** card — nothing is modified silently.

### ⚡ Inline Edit — Cursor-style (Pro)
Select any code, press `Ctrl+Alt+K`, type an instruction, and the selection is rewritten in place.

### 💬 Smart Chat (Free)
Ask anything about your code. Type `@filename` to inject any file into the conversation. Type `/` to see all available commands.

### 🔀 Git Integration (Pro)
Generate commit messages, push to remote, and check git status — all from the chat panel.

## How the Agent Works (Pro)

When you ask Freebird to perform a task, it runs an agent loop — similar to Cursor Composer:

1. **Reads** your workspace file tree automatically
2. **Fetches** specific files it needs
3. **Searches** the codebase for symbols, patterns, or text
4. **Edits** files with targeted diffs — Approve / Reject before anything changes
5. **Creates** new files — preview shown before creation
6. **Runs** terminal commands — shown before execution
7. **Commits and pushes** — requires your explicit approval

Nothing is modified silently. You stay in full control.
